# Self-Host a Burla Cluster

### Where can I deploy my Burla Cluster?

Burla is built to be self-hosted in the cloud.

Currently, Burla can only be deployed in GCP (relies on google cloud firestore).\
We fully intend to eventually support AWS and Azure, please email me ([jake@burla.dev](mailto:jake@burla.dev)) if you're an AWS/Azure shop and you're really interested in Burla.

### How do I install Burla in my GCP Project?

As of 2/5/25 Burla is hardcoded to use only our public demo cluster ([cluster.burla.dev](https://cluster.burla.dev)).\
This is a very high priority item for us to fix, if you're interested in self-hosting, please email me ([jake@burla.dev](mailto:jake@burla.dev))!
