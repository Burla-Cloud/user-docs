### FAQ:

**How much free compute do I get ?**

This is determined on a case by case basis depending on the kind of work you're doing and how much feedback you're willing to share. It usually ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.

**Security ?**

Each managed Burla deployment is created in completely separate Google Cloud Project (VPC).\
Compute resources are never shared between users.

**How much does it cost ?**

We charge a simple 2x multiple whatever charges originate from your instance according to Google Cloud Billing, this equates to about $0.08 per cpu-hour.

**Why so expensive ?**

Because we don't really want you to use our managed service! (not forever at least)

Burla is open-source, and designed to be self-hosted.\
We created the managed-service to make Burla as easy as possible to try.\
If you try it and like it, we're happy to help install the self-hosted version, it only takes [one command](API-Reference.md#burla-install).
