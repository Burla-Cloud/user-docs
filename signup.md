{% endhint %}

### FAQ:

**Security ?**

Each managed Burla deployment is created in completely separate Google Cloud Project (VPC).\
Compute resources are never shared between users.

**How much does it cost ?**

If you run out of credits, and want to keep using Burla without [self-hosting](get-started.md#quickstart-self-hosted), we charge a simple 2x multiple of any charges that originate from your instance according to Google Cloud Billing.

**Any other questions?**
