### We build free custom examples!

[Schedule a call](https://cal.com/jakez/burla?user=jakez\&duration=30) and we will build you a working proof of concept specific to your workload.\
We've built functional, plug and play examples for companies working on:

* DNA analysis / genomic pipelining
* Medical image processing for ML
* Video game replay analysis
* Reinforcement learning simulations
* Industrial CT-scan analysis



### FAQ:

**Is this secure ?**

Yes, each managed Burla deployment is created in completely separate Google Cloud Project (VPC).\
Compute resources are never shared between users.

**How much does it cost ?**

If you run out of credits, and want to keep using Burla without [self-hosting](get-started.md#quickstart-self-hosted), we charge a simple 2x multiple of any fees that originate from your instance according to Google Cloud Billing. We regularly give customers full access to the underlying google cloud project running their Burla instance.
