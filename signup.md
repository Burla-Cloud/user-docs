### FAQ:

**What are the security measures ?**

Each managed Burla deployment is provisioned within its own separate virtual private cloud (VPC).\
This fully isolates all cloud resources between customers (single-tenant deployment).

**How much does it cost ?**

Burla's managed service is $100/month per user (after your free trial credits have run out).\
All underlying cloud costs (compute, storage) are forwarded at current GCP prices.

**Any other questions?**
