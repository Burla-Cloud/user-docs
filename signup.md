### Want us to build you a demo?

[Schedule a call](https://cal.com/jakez/burla?user=jakez\&duration=30) and we will build you a working proof of concept specific to your workload.\
We've built demos for companies working on:

* DNA analysis / genomic pipelining
* Medical image preprocessing for ML
* Reinforcement learning simulations
* Video game replay analysis

### FAQ:

**Is this secure ?**

Yes, each managed Burla deployment is created in completely separate Google Cloud Project (VPC).\
Compute resources are never shared between users.

**How much does it cost ?**

If you run out of credits, and want to keep using Burla without [self-hosting](get-started.md#quickstart-self-hosted), we charge a simple 2x multiple of any charges that originate from your instance according to Google Cloud Billing.

**Any other questions?**
