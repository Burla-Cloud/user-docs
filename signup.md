### FAQ:

**Security ?**

Each managed Burla deployment is created in completely separate Google Cloud Project (VPC).\
Compute resources are never shared between users.

**How much does it cost ?**

If you run out of credits, we charge a simple 2x multiple whatever charges originate from your instance according to Google Cloud Billing, this equates to about $0.08 per cpu-hour.

**Any other questions?**
