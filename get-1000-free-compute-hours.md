# Get 1000 free compute hours!

I have a question, have you ever written software with a brick?\
Now you can!

Unironically though, every burla brick comes with 1000 Free CPU-Hours of compute on a private managed burla-cluster. At $100 for 1000 CPU-Hours, it's actually not a bad a deal!

The only brick you can write software with!
