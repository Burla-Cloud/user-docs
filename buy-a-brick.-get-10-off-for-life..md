# Buy a brick. Get 10% off for life.

### Why are you selling bricks?

At Burla.dev, our mission is to make cloud infrastructure fun.\
We enable rapid progress with very simple primitives, like `remote_parallel_map`.\
What's more fun than rapid progress?\
\
To symbolize this, we're offering bricks—the fundamental building blocks of construction. By purchasing a brick, you support our mission and become part of a community. A community that together, is building the future of cloud computing, one brick at a time.​

Bricks are customized (on the back) with your name or your company name, and a sequential serial number to identify it. Every brick also comes with a handwritten note from [us](about.md), the founders.

### One caviot:

To clarify, ANY future software services we do or will offer are eligible for this 10% lifetime discount.

When purchasing specifically **compute services** from us (which you would only do if you are using a **fully-managed** Burla cluster that is **not self-hosted**) your 10% lifetime discount applies exclusively to any margin or service fee, not the total transaction amount. Otherwise we would be selling compute for less than we paid for it!

Brick discounts cannot be transferred.
