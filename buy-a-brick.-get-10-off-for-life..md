# Buy a brick. Get 10% off for life.

### Why are you selling bricks?

At Burla.dev, our mission is to make cloud infrastructure fun.\
We enable rapid progress using very simple primitives, like `remote_parallel_map`.\
What's more fun than rapid progress?\
\
To symbolize this, we're offering bricks—the fundamental building blocks of construction. By purchasing a brick, you support our mission and become part of a community. A community that together, is building the future of cloud computing, one brick at a time.​
