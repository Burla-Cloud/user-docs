# Use a private managed Cluster

### Who is this for?

Burla is designed to be self-hosted in the cloud.\
However, for select users, we give access to private, managed, burla clusters running in our cloud.

These deployments are fully managed by us, and are available at your own custom `.burla.dev` domain. They are also completely private, run behind an identity proxy, and are only accessible by you.

If you're interested a your own fully-managed Burla deployment please email me at [jake@burla.dev](https://app.gitbook.com/u/vjhGohhUhsQhYKnFjO0y1B7Ajh82).\
Or schedule a meeting with me here: [cal.com/jakez](https://cal.com/jakez)

### Pricing:

We charge a flat 1.5x multiple of our underlying compute cost from your deployment.\
If you spend $100 on compute, we will bill you for $150.
