# Software as a Service Agreement

This Software as a Service Agreement (“Agreement”) governs access to and use of Burla’s cloud-based software and services (the “Service”) by the customer (“Customer” or “you”).

#### Acceptance

This Agreement is accepted electronically by Customer upon any of the following:\
(a) approval of a quote issued by Burla through Stripe,\
(b) completion of payment through Burla’s Stripe-hosted payment portal,\
(c) payment of an invoice issued by Burla through Stripe, or\
(d) accessing or using the Service.

If this Agreement is attached to or referenced by a Stripe quote or invoice, Customer’s approval or payment constitutes acceptance of this Agreement. No separate written signature or order form is required.

***

#### 1. Service

Burla provides access to its cloud-based software platform solely for Customer’s internal business use.

***

#### 2. Fees and Usage-Based Billing

Customer agrees to pay all fees presented through Stripe or invoiced by Burla through Stripe.

In addition to any subscription, seat-based, or fixed fees, Customer is responsible for all compute usage incurred through the Service. Compute usage is billed on a pass-through basis at a one-to-one (1:1) rate equal to Burla’s underlying cloud infrastructure costs.

For example, if Customer consumes one thousand dollars ($1,000) worth of cloud compute resources during a billing period, Burla will pay such costs directly and subsequently invoice Customer for one thousand dollars ($1,000).

Compute usage is reconciled monthly and invoiced in arrears unless otherwise agreed in writing. Invoices are due net thirty (30) days from the invoice date. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law.

***

#### 3. Acceptable Use

Customer will use the Service only for lawful purposes and will maintain the confidentiality and security of account credentials.\
Customer will not resell, sublicense, or provide the Service to any third party, nor attempt to bypass security controls or abuse the platform.

***

#### 4. Customer Data

Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any data submitted to or generated through the Service (“Customer Data”).

Burla may process Customer Data solely to provide and support the Service. Burla does not use Customer Data to train models, improve unrelated products, or for marketing purposes.

***

#### 5. Data Security

Burla will maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, as described in Burla’s Privacy Policy available at:\
[https://docs.burla.dev/privacy-policy](https://docs.burla.dev/privacy-policy)

Burla may access Customer Data only as necessary to provide the Service or as required by law.

***

#### 6. Availability and Support

Uptime is not guaranteed.

In the event of a service disruption, Burla will make reasonable efforts to respond within twenty four (24) hours, and in many cases within two (2) hours, after becoming aware of the issue. This does not constitute a service level agreement.

***

#### 7. Intellectual Property

Burla retains all right, title, and interest in the Service and all related intellectual property.\
No ownership rights are transferred to Customer under this Agreement.

***

#### 8. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to keep confidential any non-public business, technical, or operational information disclosed by the other party and to use such information solely to perform under this Agreement, unless disclosure is required by law.

***

#### 9. Termination, Cancellation, and Data Deletion

Customer may cancel any subscription at any time. Cancellation will be effective at the end of the then-current billing period, provided that cancellation occurs at least **seven (7) days prior to the start of the next billing period**. Customer will not be charged for subsequent billing periods. Fees paid for the current billing period are non-refundable.

Burla may suspend or terminate access to the Service for non-payment, misuse, or security risk.

Upon termination or expiration of the Service, Customer will have thirty (30) days to export any Customer Data stored in the Service. After that period, Burla will permanently delete Customer’s software instance and all associated Customer Data.

Burla may retain limited metadata solely for internal accounting and compliance purposes, including aggregate compute usage metrics, which do not include Customer Data.

***

#### 10. Disclaimer

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

***

#### 11. Indemnification

Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Burla from any claims arising out of Customer Data or Customer’s violation of this Agreement.

Burla agrees to defend and indemnify Customer against third-party claims alleging that the Service, when used as permitted under this Agreement, infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.

***

#### 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BURLA’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO BURLA IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

BURLA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

***

#### 13. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles.

***

#### 14. Survival

Sections relating to Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Disclaimer, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, and Data Deletion shall survive termination of this Agreement.
