# Software as a Service Agreement

This Software as a Service Agreement (“Agreement”) governs access to and use of Burla’s cloud-based software and services (the “Service”) by the customer (“Customer” or “you”). Acceptance of this Agreement occurs electronically through Burla’s Stripe-hosted payment portal or by accessing or using the Service. No separate order form is required.

***

#### 1. Service

Burla provides access to its cloud-based software platform solely for Customer’s internal business use.

***

#### 2. Fees

Customer agrees to pay all fees presented through Burla’s Stripe-hosted checkout or on invoice. Fees are non-refundable unless required by law.

***

#### 3. Acceptable Use

Customer will use the Service only for lawful purposes and will maintain the confidentiality and security of account credentials. Customer will not resell, sublicense, or provide the Service to any third party, nor attempt to bypass security controls or abuse the platform.

***

#### 4. Customer Data

Customer retains all right, title, and interest in any data submitted to or generated through the Service (“Customer Data”). Burla may process Customer Data solely to provide and support the Service. Burla does not use Customer Data to train models, improve unrelated products, or for marketing purposes.

***

#### 5. Data Security

Burla will maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards designed to protect Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, as described in Burla’s Privacy Policy available at [https://docs.burla.dev/privacy-policy](https://docs.burla.dev/privacy-policy). Burla may access Customer Data only as necessary to provide the Service or as required by law.

***

#### 6. Availability and Support

Uptime is not guaranteed. In the event of a service disruption, Burla will make reasonable efforts to respond within twenty four (24) hours, and in many cases within two (2) hours, after becoming aware of the issue. This does not constitute a service level agreement.

***

#### 7. Intellectual Property

Burla retains all right, title, and interest in the Service and all related intellectual property. No ownership rights are transferred to Customer under this Agreement.

***

#### 8. Confidentiality

Each party agrees to keep confidential any non-public business, technical, or operational information disclosed by the other party and to use such information solely to perform under this Agreement, unless disclosure is required by law.

***

#### 9. Termination and Data Deletion

Customer may stop using the Service at any time. Burla may suspend or terminate access for non-payment, misuse, or security risk. Upon termination or expiration of the Service, Customer will have thirty (30) days to export any Customer Data stored in the Service. After that period, Burla will permanently delete Customer’s software instance and all associated Customer Data. Burla may retain limited metadata solely for internal accounting and compliance purposes, including aggregate compute usage, which does not include Customer Data.

***

#### 10. Disclaimer

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

***

#### 11. Indemnification

Customer agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Burla from any claims arising out of Customer Data or Customer’s violation of this Agreement. Burla agrees to defend and indemnify Customer against third-party claims alleging that the Service, when used as permitted under this Agreement, infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.

***

#### 12. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BURLA’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER TO BURLA IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. BURLA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.

***

#### 13. Governing Law

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of law principles.

***

#### 14. Survival

Sections relating to Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Disclaimer, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, and Data Deletion shall survive termination of this Agreement.
