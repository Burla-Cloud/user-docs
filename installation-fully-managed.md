# Installation: Fully-Managed

{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Fully-Managed deployments are manually created on an individual basis.

We fully intend to make this process 100% self-serve, but haven't yet.\
For now, simply email us!
{% endhint %}

### Instructions:

1. E-Mail [jake@burla.dev](https://app.gitbook.com/u/vjhGohhUhsQhYKnFjO0y1B7Ajh82) or schedule a meeting here: [cal.com/jakez](https://cal.com/jakez)
2. I'll reply as quickly as possible with further instructions!

### FAQ:

**Security:**

Managed Burla deployments are created in separate projects each in a separate VPC.\
By default Burla deployments only allow access to those in the authorized-user list in the settings tab, which means we can't actually observe your instance without explicitly manually modifying your database.

**How do pay?**

We use Stripe Billing to facilitate Payments.\
By default Burla tracks the number compute hours used on a per-user basis.

**How much does compute cost?**

We simply charge 2x what Google Cloud charges us for your instance.\
Or about $0.05 per cpu-hour.
