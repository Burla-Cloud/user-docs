# Get 1000 free compute hours.

I have a question, have you ever written software with a brick? Now you can!

Unironically though, our bricks come with 1000 CPU-hours of compute in a private managed Burla cluster. At $100 per brick, it's actually a pretty good deal. As always we provide free hands on help, and white glove service to any users of a managed cluster. Show support, and get a brick today!
